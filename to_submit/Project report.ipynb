    "And then do a normalization to make the values be between [-0.5,0.5]. The main reason for the normalization is to reduce the numerical error during the optimization process. In addition, keeping the inputs in normalized shapes help the optimizer to find the minimum cost faster.\n",

    "\n",
    "To cross validate my model, I randomly split the training data into a training set and validation set. I did this by shuffle [x_train,y_train} first and then assign 30% of the training data as the validation data.\n",

    "04: 03 + drop out\n",
    "\n",
    "The peformance for these four architectures are similar, they both achieve around 99% accuracy on the validation data after around 30 epochs. The 04 method do get to the final accuracy a little bit faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I chose LeNet as the base structure is because that LeNet has been proven to do a great job in recognizing english letters, which has similar complexity and similar required resolution as compared to the traffic signs.\n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of the learning rate, there is also no significant difference. The model did train slower with the 0.0002 learning rate, i.e., get to 99% accuracy slower.
